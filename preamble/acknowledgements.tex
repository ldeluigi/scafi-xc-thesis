Thanks for all your time and guidance.

Next, I would like to thank my family, who supported my studies and my choices and accompanied me on this journey.

A special thanks goes to my beloved girlfriend, Giada, who has always been by my side in the past years, supporting and helping me to overcome the difficulties I encountered, and accompanying me in my new life in Rimini.

Finally, I would like to thank all my close friends, with whom I have shared great moments, studying with the \textit{Spaceteam}, playing board games with \textit{Zuga RÃ¨mni}, living the university with \textit{S.P.R.I.Te.}, and working with \textit{EasyDesk}.
