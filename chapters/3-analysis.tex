This chapter defines the scope, requirements, and use cases of \this, as well as their analysis and prioritization.

\section{Requirement analysis}

Since the very beginning, \this aimed to redesign ScaFi using Scala 3 to improve the quality of the code, including but not limited to readability, maintainability, and reusability.
%
This time, using the \ac{XC} as the theoretical foundation, through which the \ac{FC} constructs could be implemented.

The project started interviewing the stakeholders, which are the developers and researchers who use ScaFi, to understand their needs and expectations.

The \textit{key users} identified for the library are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{End users}, that is, the developers who will use the library to implement their aggregate programs;
    \item \textit{Library developers}, who will extend the library with new features, constructs, and syntax;
    \item \textit{Researchers}, who will experiment with the calculus foundations but would benefit from reusing existing libraries.
\end{itemize}

During the interviews, both functional and technical requirements emerged and were collected and given priorities based on further discussions and feedback from the stakeholders.

\paragraph{Functional requirements} are the features that the library must provide to the users. The following are the most relevant functional requirements identified:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{F.\arabic*}]
    \item Redesign and implement a new \ac{API} for the \texttt{core} package\cref{chap:analysis->sec:scafi-analysis};
    \item Redesign and implement the \texttt{tests} package with acceptance tests, easy to read and understand, and that can be used as examples;
    \item Use the \ac{XC} as the foundation of the (default) implementation of constructs, while still providing a \ac{FC} based API;
    \item Develop an \textit{Alchemist incarnation}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/AlchemistSimulator/Alchemist}}\cite{alchemist}, enabling \this programs to run on the well-tested and widely used Alchemist simulator;
    \item Develop a minimal, pure Scala 3 simulator to run tests and examples without the need for external dependencies;
    \item Provide a new API for the \texttt{core} package that allows developers to import arbitrary ScaFi libraries and constructs into their programs without conflicts, in a seamless way;
    \item Prefer keeping the original, abbreviated names for core constructs like \texttt{nbr} and \texttt{rep}, now that they are widely adopted and recognized by the community;
    \item Experiment with Scala 3 to achieve new, compile time features for ScaFi that can improve the quality of the code and the user experience.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Technical requirements} are the constraints and guidelines that the library must follow to ensure the quality of the code and the user experience.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{T.\arabic*}]
    \item Use Scala 3 as the host language;
    \item Enable quality options on the Scala 3 compiler such as explicit nulls (\cref{chap:background->sec:scala3->subsec:explicit-nulls}) and multiversal equality (\cref{chap:background->sec:scala3->subsec:multiversal-equality});
    \item Use \ac{SBT} as build system;
    \item Cross-build the project for \textit{scala-js}\footnote{\url{https://www.scala-js.org}};
    \item Cross-build the project for \textit{scala-native}\footnote{\url{https://scala-native.org}};
    \item Lint the code with \textit{scalafix}\footnote{\url{https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix}} and/or \textit{scalafmt}\footnote{\url{https://scalameta.org/scalafmt}};
    \item Avoid using third-party libraries for the \texttt{core} package dependencies.
\end{enumerate}

Then, the requirements were discussed and prioritized, following the \ac{MoSCoW} method,
resulting in the table in \cref{tab:requirements-prioritization}.

    \textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{MoSCoW} & \textbf{Priority}  \\ 
    \hline
    F.1          & must   & high      \\ 
    \hline
    F.2          & must   & high      \\

    \hline
    F.7          & should & average   \\ 
    \hline
    F.8          & won't  & low       \\ 
    \hline
    T.1          & must   & high      \\ 
    \hline
    T.2          & should & high      \\ 
    \hline
    T.3          & must   & high      \\ 
    \hline
    T.4          & could  & low       \\ 
    \hline
    T.5          & could  & low       \\ 
    \hline
    T.6          & should & low       \\ 
    \hline
    T.7          & should & average   \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Finally, before starting with the design of the solution, given that the project is a redesign of an existing library, the requirements were compared with the existing ScaFi library to identify the differences and similarities.



\section{Analysis of the ScaFi framework} \label{chap:analysis->sec:scafi-analysis}

The ScaFi repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/scafi/scafi}} is organized in modules as pictured in \cref{fig:scafi-project-org}.
%
For most of the use cases, only a small subset of the modules should be imported.
%
The \this project is scoped around redesigning and implementing mainly the \texttt{core} package, implicitly including \texttt{commons}, and then the \texttt{simulator} and \texttt{tests} packages, albeit with a minimal version of the simulator in pure Scala 3.
%
The rest of the modules, providing various \ac{GUI} implementations, demos, as well as integration with \textit{Akka}\footnote{\url{https://akka.io}} for actual deployment of real-world aggregate applications, are out of the scope of \this, and are addressed in \cref{chap:conclusion-and-future-work}.

To use a library component in ScaFi, the user must mix in the library trait with the \texttt{AggregateProgram} base class, as shown in \cref{lst:using-libraries-in-scafi}.
